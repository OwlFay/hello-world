# hello-world
my first repository
A bit about me, myself and I.
That first night I spent locked in the shed was a long and dreary one. 
It rained off and on and I had diffiulties sleeping in my new environment on the shelf.
I was used to hearing mice running about in the dark, but there were some new sounds that I had to guess at their cause.
I felt strange things crawling over my paws and hopping about my person, smallish things with long skinny legs.
I ignored them all. I was too exhausted to do anything except curl up there on the cloth bag on the shelf and hope that tomorrow the farmer would realize where I was and what had happened and come let me out.
